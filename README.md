## This is my first website 0.2
I create this website after I learned Flexbox and Grid, I wanted to practice what I learned. At that time, my biggest problem was how to create a navbar.
I built using:
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript (**)

** The javascript code I use I took it from **3W School**. This is from where I took the code : [Here](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_scroll_to_top.asp)

## Visit the website
You can visit the website clicking [Here](https://myfirstwebsite0-2.netlify.app/)

## What is it about
Mainly is about the two sections I created, one Grid and the another one using FlexBox.
